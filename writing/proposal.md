# Project Proposal by Add Team Member Names

Note: Please offer screen shots where possible to help the reader to understand.


## Proposed Project Idea

TODO: In clear and meaningful language describe your mathematical contept or idea for a final project. Describe the how this project connects to Discrete Structures. How do you intend to showcase the concept using computer code? Please include any other background reference material you used to develop the idea for your project (links are okay).

## Goals

In the below bulleted list, please include the parameters of your project that are to be met in order to consider the project _completed_. Below, list five goals that you set to complete for the project. These goals must be specific, easily verifiable, and be an important part of the project's success.

* 1. TODO
* 2. TODO
* 3. TODO

* 5. TODO

## Feasibility

TODO: Explain why your proposed idea is feasible. How do you know that the project is able to be demonstrated using computer code? In other words, how are you sure to be able to make a successful demonstration of the concept using code given the limitations of Computer Science for completing Mathematical calculations. 

## Hurdles

TODO: Describe any possible problems that your demonstration project may meet such as the availability of data, literature, lack of libraries or other methods to complete the project. How will you address these hardships? How could you demonstrate the concept in absence of these resources?
